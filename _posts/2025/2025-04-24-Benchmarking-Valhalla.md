## Abstract

Project Valhalla introduces value types into the Java language and virtual machine. Value types can be more efficient since they do not need pointer indirection and heap allocation. Moreover, Valhalla will lead to a more regular object model, unifying primitive types and their boxed types, and to simpler parameterized types. In this presentation, you will learn about the present state of the project so that you can evaluate its impact on your Java workloads. You will also see how to measure performance improvements so you can track them as they happen.

⚠️ Der Vortrag ist auf Deutsch geplant. 

⚠️ The lecture is planned in German. However, it can also be held in English if there is interest.
