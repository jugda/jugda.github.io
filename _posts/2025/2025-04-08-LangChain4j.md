## Abstract

Generative AI burst on to the public scene in November 2022, over ten years after Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning premiered on Coursera. Java developers have long felt like second class citizens, compared to the cool Python kids. LangChain4J changes the game. Java is cool with AI now! This lecture from 30-year industry veteran Ed Burns explores why it took so long for Java developers to have access to easy-to-use AI libraries, compared to Python developers. LangChain4J is the most popular of the Java libraries, but others exist. After a brief look at the landscape, we’ll take a deeper look at LangChain4J and how you use it to perform the most popular AI usage pattern: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is basically a way to bring your own domain specific data to an existing AI model, and benefit from its power.

Fun Fact: My first professional conference experience was at the Third International WWW conference in Darmstadt, nearly 30 years ago: https://archives.iw3c2.org/www3/ . I coined the term "webcast" with a piece of software I wrote and presented there: https://archives.iw3c2.org/www3/mbone/webcast.html .
