### Zusammenfassung

_(Vortrag wird auf deutsch sein, Abstract liegt bislang nur in English vor)_

Scala 3 is on the horizon, and in many ways, it is a completely new language. 
If you have have already formed an opinion on Scala, you would do well to take a fresh and impartial look at its latest incarnation. 
In this talk, I will show you why Scala 3 is relevant in 2021. 
A lot has happened since Scala 2 came out. 
Java slowly adopted some of the features, and Kotlin emerged as a better Java. 
Scala 3 ups the ante and once more gives a fresh impetus to the landscape of JVM languages. 
I will give an overview of what Scala 3 brings to the table â€” not as a language for functional programming experts, but as a serious alternative for Java and Kotlin developers.
